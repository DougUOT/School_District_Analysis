# School_District_Analysis
Utilizing Python, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda and the Pandas library and to examine School District Data and showcase trends in school performance

## Overview of Project

This project regarding Module 4: PycitySchools, working with Anaconda and one of its items, Jupyter Notebook, using Python and Pandas library. We work with raw data information from CSV documents, examine and clean information, blend datasets, perform mathematical calculations and apply the groupby function to a DataFrame. This assignment is related to the Bootcamp Data Analytics from the University of Toronto.

We need to import two files [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/DougUOT/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/DougUOT/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv) into Jupyter Notebook using Python and working with two main goals for this module:

1) The first objective is to develop a data analysis generating the school and district summary, containing some key metrics, such as: top five and top bottom performing schools, based on the overall passing rate, math media and reading of each grade level of each school and finally the scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
two) 

2) The educational committee has advised Maria and her chief that the students_complete.csv record shows proof of scholarly untrustworthiness; explicitly, perusing and math grades for Thomas High School 9th graders seem to have been modified. Albeit the educational committee doesn't have a clue about the full degree of scholastic untruthfulness, they need to maintain state-testing norms. We need to supplant the math and perusing scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the remainder of the information unblemished. We need to rehash the school district analysis and review a report to depict what these changes affected the overall analysis.
